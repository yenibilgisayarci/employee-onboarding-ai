## Introduction

Onboarding new employees can be a complex and time-consuming process. Traditional methods often involve extensive paperwork, repetitive training sessions, and a lack of personalized engagement. Our **Employee Onboarding AI** framework aims to simplify this process by leveraging advanced technologies to create a more efficient and engaging experience.

This repository serves as a foundation for organizations looking to enhance their onboarding processes. By using AI and machine learning, we provide tools that can tailor the onboarding experience to individual needs, ensuring a smoother transition into the workplace.

## Features

- **Automated Document Handling**: Seamlessly manage onboarding documents in PDF format.
- **Personalized Training Modules**: Create custom training sessions based on the employee's role and background.
- **NLP Integration**: Utilize Natural Language Processing to analyze and respond to employee queries.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Adapt the onboarding process based on feedback and performance metrics.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple navigation for both HR personnel and new hires.
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Track progress and identify areas for improvement.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing the framework.
- **TensorFlow**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **spaCy**: A powerful NLP library for processing text.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for creating the user interface.
- **PostgreSQL**: For managing data and storing employee information.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application for easy deployment.
